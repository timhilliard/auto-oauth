# auto-oauth
Automatically select and login to site using your preferred Google or Microsoft identity.

## Overview
When you have multiple Google or Microsoft accounts (for work, home, etc) every time you try 
to log into a website via OAuth, like with the "Login with Google" button, you have to choose
the account you want to use.

This extension allows you to choose a selected account per site that you'll always want to use
in the future - one fewer click!
